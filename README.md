# xs-and-os

Welcome to a simple game of Tic Tac Toe, or X's and O's as we say in Ireland. It's simple, get three symbols in a row and you win.

The main goal of this project was to work on writing cleaner, more organised code using private functions and variables. Everything in the code is wrapped into two IIFE, the gameBoard and the displayControl.
